	<p> My name is Noura Ali. Since i was in secondary school, i felt interested about technologies and wanted to work with them. <br> Then my dreams came true, when i joined Faculty of Engineering Computer department. With some wires and lines of code, you find yourself connecting people all around the world.<br> Connectivity isn't only confined to people, but also to things.</p>
