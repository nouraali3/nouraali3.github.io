			<p> My name is Noura Ali. Since i was in secondary school, i always felt interested about technologies and wanted to explore this new whole world that utilized the power of technologies. <br><br> I chose to join faculty of engineering and to specialize in computer engineering. I started by exploring virtual and augmented reality to figure out what lies behind the scenes with the headsets on our heads. Also, i coded mobile applications with android to get grasp of how applications run on our mobiles. Then i started to learn about problem solving using Java that lead me to the IoT field where connectivity isn't only confined to people, but also to things. With some wires and lines of code, you find yourself connecting people and things all around the world. Finally, i graduated with very good overall grade.<br> I am currently trying to utilize everything i learnt througout my journey and doing my best to learn more.</p>
